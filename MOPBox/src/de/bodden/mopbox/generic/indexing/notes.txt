Note on C+ algorithm:

The use of creation events appears to be incorrect. The problem is that when creation events are used,
one may incorrectly skip monitor-discarding events at the beginning of the trace.

For instance, a trace "a b" over the property "b with no a before" would falsely be reduced to
just "b", because "a" is not a creation event.

But then I think that JavaMop requires you to tag creation events explicitly...
